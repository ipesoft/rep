Regional Plants
===============

Regional Plants is a web application designed to store and share data about regional flora (with emphasis in trees), including descriptive, ethnobotany and historical data. The idea is to:

- Facilitate restoration and urban forestry efforts by providing detailed information and search capabilities related to the native flora of a certain region;
- Promote the interest of the general public in the native vegetation;
- Combine history, ethnobotany and forest data in a new way, including information about the use of each species and its relationship with the local community over the time;
- Provide a replicable model that can be applied to other regions interested in a similar system.

This work is part of a larger project funded by the JRS Biodiversity Foundation and coordinated by IPÊ (Instituto de Pesquisas Ecológicas) for the region of Nazaré Paulista, São Paulo, Brazil.

The system was developed in Python using the Django Framework.

Features
========

The system is still under development and only the administrative module for descriptive data is currently available.
